# Introduction

This project was developed with the motivation of overcoming a real case provided to us by [NTT DATA](https://es.nttdata.com) during a masterclass organized in their A Coru√±a headquarters.

# Goal

We had a lot of goals here:

* Being capable of solving the three challenges from NTT Data over this dataset:

    * Realizing an exploratory data analysis over the distinct client profiles
    * Predict which clients would be more likely to contract a fixed deposit or to reject it
    * Deploying this solution to production 

* Making sure that this NTT Data challenges fitted perfectly with the ones from [Hack a Boss](https://www.hackaboss.com/data-science-bootcamp-02):

    * Development of a Streamlit webapp to showcase our results
    * Include a Power BI embedded in our Streamlit webapp
    * Test our Machine Learning model live

* And of course our own requisites and challenges:

    * Explore and implement new technologies as we've been doing in our last projects
    * Learn a lot from Cloud development
    * Do it in a week


# Web app for testing!

In this [web](https://fixed-deposit-predictor.streamlit.app) you can try our models and get a little more info about the results of the challenges explained in this readme.

We really hope you like it and share your thoughts!
